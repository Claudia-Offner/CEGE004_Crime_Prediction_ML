### Machine Learning - Group Assignment

This is a repository for the Machine Learning Module (CEGE0004) at UCL. This is a join project between Claudia Offner, Indigo Brownhall, Emily Birch, Chenjie Li and Leyang Xiao. The primary learning task for this project is classification of high and low violent crime in the United States. To do this, the methodology optimizes four weak learner algorithms from the following machine learning families: Decision Trees, Instance-based Learning, Neural Networks, and Bayesian Learning. The performances of our selected learners will be measured by their accuracy scores on a test set, after being optimized using a training set and k-fold cross validation method. Each of the models has its own designated Jupyter notebook that can be dowloaded and ran. Each model depends on the Preprocessing file that should be run first.
